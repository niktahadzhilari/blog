## 🧾 What Are Lightweight Markup Languages?

**Lightweight markup languages** are formats used to structure text using simple, human-readable symbols. Unlike heavy markup like HTML or LaTeX, they are easy to read in raw form and are widely used for:

- 📄 writing documentation,
- 📝 preparing scientific or technical texts,
- 📢 publishing in blogs and forums,
- 🧰 formatting README files and wiki pages.

---

## 📚 Why Are They Useful?

The goal of lightweight markup is to make documents **readable by both humans and machines**, without relying on complex syntax. These languages:

- simplify technical writing;
- are well-suited for collaborative work with Git;
- are used in many static site generators (e.g., Hugo, Jekyll, Sphinx);
- can be easily converted to HTML, PDF, and other formats.
