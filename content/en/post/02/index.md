## ðŸ“… Week 2 (May 27 â€“ June 2) â€” Integrals and Conditions

In **mathematical analysis**, we started the topic of **integrals**. There were many problems involving different substitutions. I practiced both definite and indefinite integrals â€” solving half of them manually, and the rest using SymPy.

In **programming**, we moved on to functions and modules. We wrote a module for basic arithmetic operations and imported it into another script â€” it really made me feel like a real developer.
