## ðŸ“… Week 4 (June 10â€“16) â€” First Exam Session!

This was my **first real exam session** at the university. I took the exam in **mathematical analysis** â€” I got a lucky ticket with derivatives, extrema, and Lagrangeâ€™s theorem. The flashcards I made came in very handy.

For the **programming exam**, we had to write a sorting function and test it. I received a good grade â€” the instructor complimented me on clean code and the use of `assert`. Definitely the highlight of the week! ðŸŽ‰
