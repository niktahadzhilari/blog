## ðŸ“… Week 5 (June 17â€“23) â€” Reflections and Gratitude

The academic year has come to an end. The final assessment was an **oral exam in mathematical logic**. We discussed formal systems, propositional calculus, and logical consequences.

During the final **programming class**, we presented our mini-projects â€” I demonstrated a simple text-based RPG where the player explores different rooms. I received helpful feedback and an idea on how to improve the architecture.

I'm truly grateful to all my professors and classmates for such an intense and inspiring first year! ðŸ’«
